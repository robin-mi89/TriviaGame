          You generally want to stick javascript script tags at the bottom of your body.
          This is because they will stop the rest of the html from being parsed and rendered
          until after the script has finished downloading and it's best practice to show 
          something to the user asap even if it's not initially interactive
          (most users won't even notice ðŸ™ƒ).
